# Hi, I'm Jason! I'm a Smart Contract Engineer.

## Projects:

### Blockchain Development (Solidity Projects)
- [Comprehensive Blockchain Projects and Implementations](https://github.com/jason-victor1/Blockchain-Development.git)
  - Includes smart contract development using Solidity, focused on creating and auditing decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and advanced ERC token standards.

### AI/ML Python Projects
- [IN PROGRESS]

## Problem-Solving Highlights:
### Solidity Compiler Troubleshooting
In my blockchain development journey, I encountered challenges with Solidity compiler mismatches and misconfigurations. Through persistent troubleshooting, I implemented solutions to resolve issues with `solc` installations, version mismatches, and CI/CD configurations. These efforts demonstrated my abilities to:
- Debug and resolve complex issues in development environments.
- Ensure consistent configurations across local setups and GitHub Actions workflows.
- Manage multiple compiler versions efficiently using tools like `solc-select`.

You can find more details about these solutions in the [Solidity Compiler Troubleshooting Repository](https://github.com/jason-victor1/solidity-compiler-troubleshooting.git).
